These past three we manage to get through all those challenges, and here we are again, LDR na pud.<br>
Despite being LDR I know I can provide most of your needs, and whatnot except, being physically present.<br>
But just know that our love still growing strong! you are my rock, my joy, and my everything.
Even though you see yourself as a burden, I am very much grateful every day for your existence, So please don't think about being a burden to me.<br>
I am happy to give you the things that you deserve!<br>
Your presence in my life has brought me more happiness and fulfillment than I ever thought possible.<br> I look forward to many more years of love.
Thank you for being the light in my life, your understanding, and your beautiful heart.<br>
I love you more than words can express, and I am so grateful to have you as my babi palangging!.<br><br>

With all my love, Joshua The liver lover boy
